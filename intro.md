- 👋 Hi, my name is Jonathan from Montreal (Cerity06)

- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages like Python and front-end development (HTML, CSS, JS and extension (React)) as well as back-end. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS/React and I would like to learn more about back-end modules like Deno/Django.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects for NGO mostly, I work myself as a coordinator in an organism and there are a lot of needs in numerical transformation right now.
     It is also why i'm learning new skills in IT.

- 📫 How to reach me : ✨ mdjbeaujeu@gmail.com ✨
